Feature: Launch curl attack

Background:
  Given "curl" is installed
  And the following profile:
    | name     | value      |
    | hostname | ec2-34-239-201-78.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080 |

Scenario: Verify a 301 is received from a curl
  When I launch a "curl" attack with:
    """
    curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out "%{http_code}" <hostname>
    """
  # check for 302 or 301 response code
  Then the output should match /30\d+/
